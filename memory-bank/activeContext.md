# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is in its initial setup phase. The Next.js application has been bootstrapped using `create-next-app`, but further development is needed to implement the specific features and functionality required for the Kran Montaj website.

## Recent Changes
1. Project initialization with Next.js
2. Memory Bank documentation created
   - projectbrief.md
   - productContext.md
   - systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md
   - activeContext.md (this file)
   - progress.md (to be created)

## Next Steps
1. Explore and understand the existing codebase structure
2. Define the site map and page structure
3. Create basic layout components
4. Implement core pages (Home, About, Services, Projects, Contact)
5. Style the application according to brand guidelines
6. Implement responsive design
7. Add content and media assets
8. Optimize for performance and SEO
9. Test across different devices and browsers
10. Deploy to production

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Content Management**: Decide whether to use static content, a headless CMS, or a custom solution
2. **Design System**: Establish whether to build a custom design system or leverage existing UI libraries
3. **Image Handling**: Determine the approach for image optimization and responsive images
4. **Form Handling**: Choose a solution for contact form submission and validation
5. **SEO Strategy**: Define metadata approach and structured data implementation
6. **Analytics**: Decide on analytics implementation for tracking user behavior

## Important Patterns and Preferences
1. **Component Structure**: Organize components by feature or type
2. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for files and components
3. **Code Style**: Follow consistent formatting and organization patterns
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet accessibility standards
5. **Performance**: Optimize for core web vitals and overall performance

## Learnings and Project Insights
As this is the initial setup phase, specific learnings and insights will be documented as the project progresses.

## Note
This active context document will be regularly updated as work on the project evolves, decisions are made, and new insights are gained.
